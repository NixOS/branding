# NixOS Branding Guide

The **NixOS Branding Guide** defines the visual and verbal identity of the NixOS project.
It outlines how to use the NixOS logo, colors, typeface, and other design elements consistently across all forms of communication.

This guide is a reference for contributors, designers, event organizers, community members, and anyone creating content that represents the NixOS brand.

## Contents

The guide covers:

- **Logo** – Structure, variants, clear space, and misuse
- **Color Palette** – Primary, secondary, and accent colors in OKLCH space
- **Tints** – Expanded tonal values for flexible application
- **Typeface** – Route 159 and its usage across weights
- **Pride Variant** – A respectful, adapted color version of the logo
- **Visual Examples** – Correct and incorrect brand usage

## How to Use

The guide is intended to support:

- Contributors writing blog posts or documentation
- Developers building branded tools or UIs
- Event teams designing flyers, banners, or slides

If you are unsure how to apply the brand, this guide provides both principles and practical examples.

## Modifying the Guide

If you would like to propose changes to the branding guide (content, tone, layout, examples):

1. Open a GitHub issue or discussion thread first to explain your idea.
1. Include visuals or mockups to illustrate your proposal.
1. Be prepared for collaborative iteration — visual identity is a shared responsibility.

Changes that impact the core brand elements (e.g., logo geometry, primary palette, typeface) will be reviewed by the **Brand and Design Steward** in coordination with the **NixOS Marketing Team**.
