# Summary:
#   In this thread, Tim Cuthbertson responded to a request about the Nix logo
#   license and confirmed that he is okay with the logo being licensed under
#   CC BY. He wrote that CC BY had already been suggested, and expressed his
#   willingness to go along with whatever the Nix project preferred. He also
#   offered that, if desired, he could transfer or assign copyright in a way
#   that credits a project entity (for example, the Nix Foundation) rather
#   than himself.

Hi all,

Thomasz recently asked about the Nix logo license, and when I searched I
noticed there had been another question about this a few months ago on the
mailing list (which I missed).

Apologies for not addressing this sooner, I agree that we should be explicit
about the logo license. I'm happy to go along with pretty much whatever the
nix project prefers (CC-BY has already been suggested), and if there's some
official nix project entity which could be credited, I'd be happy to assign
copyright there too (so you could just credit e.g. the nix foundation, not me
specifically).

@edolstra: are you happy with a CC-BY license for the logo? I'm holding off
from _actually_ declaring it yet in case you'd prefer to restrict derivatives
or something, but if I don't hear back from you within a week I'll assume that
CC-BY is fine :). And if you are happy with CC-BY, could you go ahead and
declare that on the website / repo somewhere so we have it in writing for
anyone else that comes looking?

Cheers,
- Tim.
