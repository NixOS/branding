Hey Alexei,

I am on the Marketing Team for the NixOS project. I recently released a
branding guide for the project that uses the Jura font
(https://brand.nixos.org/documents/nixos-branding-guide.pdf). I am
vendoring the font in our branding repository
(https://github.com/NixOS/branding/tree/d1b5e1c99e44cd74bb335c3e66c52f39082da264/package-sets/top-level/jura).

It is a really great font and I want to attribute the authors
appropriately. I am working on a pull request to add licensing and
attribution information to the repository
(https://github.com/NixOS/branding/pull/29). I am having trouble with a
couple issues and am hoping you can help me out.

- Which is the most up-to-date version of the font? Which would you
  recommend I use?
- What would be the appropriate way to attribute the font?

The Cyreal website lists the following people as authors:
  Alexei Vanyashin
  Daniel Johnson
  Guldana Tauasar
  Irene Vlachou

I am considering adding the following to our README for attribution:

Jura font by
Alexei Vanyashin, Daniel Johnson, Guldana Tauasar, and Irene Vlachou
from [alexeiva/jura](https://github.com/alexeiva/jura)
licensed under [SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1]
(https://openfontlicense.org/).

Thanks in advance for your help.

All the best,  
Daniel Baker

Hello Daniel,

Thank you for reaching out! I would be glad to add the news to our
OpenCollective feed (https://opencollective.com/cyreal).

The attribution is mostly correct. I would suggest adding Cyrillic and
Greek authors in parentheses like so:

Jura font by
Alexei Vanyashin, Daniel Johnson, Guldana Tauasar (Cyrillic),
and Irene Vlachou (Greek)
from [alexeiva/jura](https://github.com/alexeiva/jura)
licensed under [SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1]
(https://openfontlicense.org/).

Would you like a customized version of Jura for NixOS? The font can be
tailored to your specific needs, shipped as “Nix Sans” for a reasonable
fee. Would be happy to discuss this further.

Best,  
Alexei
